# PredictBotnet 📡🔍

PredictBotnet is a project aimed at analyzing network traffic patterns to predict potential cyber-attacks, specifically botnets. This project leverages existing datasets containing historical network traffic and attack logs to identify patterns and anomalies associated with cyber threats, helping in early detection and prevention. We use data science techniques we learned from the CSUF CIC|PCUBED Research Summer Opportunity to model and train the datasets, ensuring accurate and efficient prediction of botnet attacks.

## 📜Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a robust and efficient model that can predict botnet attacks based on network traffic data. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📚Datasets

We use publicly available datasets from Kaggle for network malware detection and connection analysis. The primary dataset used is:

- [Network Malware Detection & Connection Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/network-malware-detection-connection-analysis/versions/1?select=CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-1-1conn.log.labeled.csv)

## ⚙️Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git cd (choose the file directory/ the location you want the file to be downloaded to) 
git clone https://github.com/aurelisajuan/PredictBotnet.git
cd PredictBotnet
```

### Installed Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📋Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis

Data preparation involves loading, cleaning, and transforming data to be suitable for analysis:

- 1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the data from the CSV file, handle missing values, and correct any inconsistencies in the data format.
- 2. **Feature Engineering**: Implement one-hot encoding for categorical data and normalize continuous features to enhance model performance.

Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and distributions in the data, including:

- 📊 Statistical summaries
- 🔗 Correlation analysis
- 📈 Visualizations of data distributions and relationships

### 🛠️Model Development

Develop the model using the following steps:

- Model Selection: Choose suitable models based on the nature of the data and the problem. For this project, we use Random Forest and K-means clustering.
- Training: Train the model on the prepared dataset.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to improve performance.

### 📊Evaluation 

Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curves

### 📈Visualization

Visualize the results and insights from the model:

- Feature importance charts
- Cluster visualizations
- Performance metrics visualizations
