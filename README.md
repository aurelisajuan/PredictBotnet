# PredictBotnet
PredictBotnet is a project aimed at developing a machine learning model to analyze network traffic patterns and predict potential cyber attacks, specifically botnets. This project leverages existing datasets containing historical network traffic and attack logs to train and validate the model, helping in early detection and prevention of cyber threats.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a robust and efficient model that can predict botnet attacks based on network traffic data. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Datasets

We use publicly available datasets from Kaggle for network malware detection and connection analysis. The primary dataset used is:

- [Network Malware Detection & Connection Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agungpambudi/network-malware-detection-connection-analysis/versions/1?select=CTU-IoT-Malware-Capture-1-1conn.log.labeled.csv)
